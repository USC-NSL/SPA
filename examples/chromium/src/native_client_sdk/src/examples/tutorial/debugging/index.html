  <h1>Native Client Debugging Example: Generating a Stack Trace.</h1>
  <h2>How the example works</h2>
  <p>This example shows how to trap an untrusted exception (such as a illegal
  memory reference in the NEXE). This debugging technique can only be used
  for development since it requires several command-line switches, and
  environment variables. The test works by loading the module and communicating
  with it through PostMessage. Messages from the module are sent to the Status
  line and/or the Log window in the page. Four seconds after the module is
  loaded, the JavaScript on this page sends a 'BOOM' message to the module that
  causes the module to dereference an illegal location in memory.</p>

  <p>If your setup is correct (you launched Chrome with the appropriate
  command-line arguments and environment variables), the Log window below
  should show that the crash dump facilities are turned on. When the crash data
  arrives from the module, the data is forwarded to the HTTP server, which
  drives a decoder and sends back a stack trace to the web page.</p>

  <p>If setup incorrectly, the NaCl module may or may not load. If the module
  loads, it sends a "LOADED" message to the log and crash after four seconds.
  Since the stack trace facilities are not enables, the script will determine
  that the module has crashed by detecting a missed heartbeat which the
  application would normally send.
  </p>

  <h2>Running the example</h2>
  In a terminal window, to automatically start Chrome with the correct
  environment variables and command-line switches:
  <ul>
    <li>Set the CHROME_PATH environment variable to the fully qualified path of
    your Chrome executable.</li>
    <li>From the debugging directory type: <b>make RUN</b></li>
  </ul>
