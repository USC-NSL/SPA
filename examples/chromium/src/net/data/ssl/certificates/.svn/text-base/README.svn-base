     These certficates are generated by

- redundant-server-chain.pem
- redundant-validated-chain-root.pem

     Two chains, A -> B -> C -> D and A -> B -> C2 (C and C2 share the same
     public key) to test that SSLInfo gets the reconstructed, re-ordered
     chain instead of the chain as served. See
     SSLClientSocketTest.VerifyReturnChainProperlyOrdered in
     net/socket/ssl_client_socket_unittest.cc. These chains are valid until
     26 Feb 2022 and are generated by
     net/data/ssl/scripts/generate-redundant-test-chains.sh.

      net/tools/testserver/minica.py

- spdy_pooling.pem : Used to test the handling of spdy IP connection pooling
     Generated by using the command
     "openssl req -x509 -days 3650 -sha1 -extensions req_spdy_pooling \
          -config ../scripts/ee.cnf -newkey rsa:1024 -text \
          -out spdy_pooling.pem"

- subjectAltName_sanity_check.pem : Used to test the handling of various types
     within the subjectAltName extension of a certificate. Generated by using
     the command
     "openssl req -x509 -days 3650 -sha1 -extensions req_san_sanity \
          -config ../scripts/ee.cnf -newkey rsa:1024 -text \
          -out subjectAltName_sanity_check.pem"

- ndn.ca.crt: "New Dream Network Certificate Authority" root certificate.
     This is an X.509 v1 certificate that omits the version field. Used to
     test that the certificate version gets the default value v1.

- websocket_cacert.pem : The testing root CA for testing WebSocket client
     certificate authentication.
     This file is used in SSLUITest.TestWSSClientCert.

- websocket_client_cert.p12 : A PKCS #12 file containing a client certificate
     and a private key created for WebSocket testing. The password is "".
     This file is used in SSLUITest.TestWSSClientCert.

- android-test-key-rsa.pem
- android-test-key-dsa.pem
- android-test-key-dsa-public.pem
- android-test-key-ecdsa.pem
- android-test-key-ecdsa-public.pem
     This is a set of test RSA/DSA/ECDSA keys used by the Android-specific
     unit test in net/android/keystore_unittest.c. They are used to verify
     that the OpenSSL-specific wrapper for platform PrivateKey objects
     works properly. See the generate-android-test-keys.sh script.

- client_1.pem
- client_1.key
- client_1_ca.pem
- client_2.pem
- client_2.key
- client_2_ca.pem
     This is a set of files used to unit test SSL client certificate
     authentication. These are generated by
     net/data/ssl/scripts/generate-client-certificates.sh
     - client_1_ca.pem and client_2_ca.pem are the certificates of
       two distinct signing CAs.
     - client_1.pem and client_1.key correspond to the certificate and
       private key for a first certificate signed by client_1_ca.pem.
     - client_2.pem and client_2.key correspond to the certificate and
       private key for a second certificate signed by client_2_ca.pem.

- eku-test-root.pem
- non-crit-codeSigning-chain.pem
- crit-codeSigning-chain.pem
     Two code-signing certificates (eKU: codeSigning; eKU: critical,
     codeSigning) which we use to test that clients are making sure that web
     server certs are checked for correct eKU fields (when an eKU field is
     present). Since codeSigning is not valid for web server auth, the checks
     should fail.
