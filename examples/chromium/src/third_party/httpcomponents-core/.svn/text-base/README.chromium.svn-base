Description:
HttpCore is a set of low level HTTP transport components that can be used to
build custom client and server side HTTP services with a minimal footprint.
HttpCore supports two I/O models: blocking I/O model based on the classic Java
I/O and non-blocking, event driven I/O model based on Java NIO.

The blocking I/O model may be more appropriate for data intensive, low latency
scenarios, whereas the non-blocking model may be more appropriate for high
latency scenarios where raw data throughput is less important than the ability
to handle thousands of simultaneous HTTP connections in a resource efficient
manner.
