Current Status as of Apr 22, 2013 (before M28 roll)

Upstream cherry-picks:

Current patches:

to_upstream/

ugly/
01_enable_checked_bitstream.patch
  dalecurtis: Removes "#define UNCHECKED_BITSTREAM_READER 1" from all codecs
  defining it. In Chromium, all codecs should use the safe bitstream reader.

02_compile_with_disabled_features.patch
  dalecurtis: Add CONFIG_* checks to compile out code which we don't use which
  might be a security risk.  Discuss with cevans before removing.  Upstream does
  not want this patch.
  wolenetz: In M27 merge, added call to matroska_read_close(s) in to this patch
  in matroska_read_header() to mitigate memory leak caught by valgrind.
  Confirmed with rbultje that this conforms to API (on error in
  matroska_read_header(), resulting state should be same as prior to call; and
  no double-free is expected to result from this either.)

07_remove_av_gettime_symlink.patch
  dalecurtis: In order to preserve ABI compatibility after av_gettime() was
  moved inside the FFmpeg code base, they added a "symbolic link" version which
  our build chain doesn't like.  Remove it until the next major version bump.
  (If FF_SYMVER is no longer present, this ugly patch can be removed.)

compile_with_no_iconv.patch
  wolenetz: When CONFIG_ICONV is 0, the original code path did not return a
  value, causing compile failure on Windows.  It also aborted via an assert.
  This patch enables compiling by returning an appropriate error code and also
  removes the assert and abort.
