  This is a 64-bit gold for arm-linux-androideabi using the
  binutils-20100303 in the Android Open Source Project.  The commit is
  e4df3e0a5bb640ccfa2f30ee67fe9b3146b152d6.  This should be the same
  source as the latest 32-bit linker binary in the AOSP (Android
  Open Source Project) tree.
  Chromium unit tests are too large to link properly with the latest
  released AOSP 32-bit linker.  The Chromium
  install-build-deps-android.sh will place this in the proper
  location.

The COPYING file is taken from binutils/binutils-20100303/COPYING of the above
repository.
