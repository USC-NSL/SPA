Description:
Jar Jar Links is a utility that makes it easy to repackage Java libraries and
embed them into your own distribution. This is useful for two reasons:

You can easily ship a single jar file with no external dependencies.
You can avoid problems where your library depends on a specific version of a
library, which may conflict with the dependencies of another library.
How does it work?

Jar Jar Links includes an Ant task that extends the built-in jar task. The
normal zipfileset element is used to embed jar files. A new rule element is
added which uses wildcards patterns to rename the embedded class files. Bytecode
transformation (via ASM) is used to change references to the renamed classes,
and special handling is provided for moving resource files and transforming
string literals.

Local Modifications:
None.

Update instructions:
1. Find the new version you want on the project website. Use as $VERSION below:
   $ VERSION={version from website}
2. Download the binary distribution Java jar and the source ZIP-archive:
   - jarjar-$VERSION.jar
   - jarjar-src-$VERSION.zip
3. Remove the contents of the binary-distribution subdirectory:
   $ rm -rf binary-distribution/*
4. Remove the src-distribution subdirectory:
   $ rm -rf src-distribution/
5. Move the binary distribution Java jar into the binary-distribution
   subdirectory:
   $ mv jarjar-$VERSION.jar binary-distribution/
6. Extract the contents of the source distribution ZIP-archive into
   src-distribution subdirectory:
   $ unzip jarjar-src-$VERSION.zip
   $ mv jarjar-$VERSION src-distribution
7. Update jarjar.gypi 'jarjar_javalib_file' with path to new Java jar, eg:
   'jarjar_javalib_file': '<(DEPTH)/third_party/jarjar/binary-distribution/jarjar-$VERSION.jar',
