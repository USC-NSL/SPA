# This is a filter description file. It can be compiled by genfilter.exe to
# produce a corresponding JSON-encoded binary filter for a given image.
#
# Blank lines are ignored, as is anything in comments.
#
# This file consists of a collection of rules, each of which will map to certain
# regions of the image that will be added or removed from the final filter. The
# rules will be processed in the order they are specified in this file.
#
# The filter starts off as being empty.
#
# Filter rules are specified in the format:
#
#   [+ or -][rule type]:[rule description]

# The following rule matches the function 'DllMain', adding the bytes
# corresponding to it to the filter.
+function:DllMain

# This rule matches all destructors adding them to the filter. Note that the
# rule description can be a Perl-compatible regular expression. They will be
# matched against undecorated function names, fully namespace qualified.
+function:.*::~.*

# This rule matches one specific destructor and removes it from the filter. The
# result is that no destructors will be instrumented, except for this one.
-function:Foo::~Foo

# This rule matches a decorated public symbol name, adding it to the filter.
+public_symbol:?function1@.*
