Security Critical: yes

Description:
Speech Dispatcher project provides a high-level device independent layer for
access to speech synthesis through a simple, stable and well documented
interface.

Local Modifications:
No modifications.
Only the libspeechd.h file is imported, as the client library (libspeechd.so.2)
is dynamically loaded (where present).

This header is imported because later versions of Speech Dispatcher (>= 0.8)
install it into a different location (${includedir}/speech-dispatcher instead
of ${includedir}) and we still need to support older versions.
