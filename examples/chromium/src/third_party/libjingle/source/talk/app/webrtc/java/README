This directory holds a Java implementation of the webrtc::PeerConnection API, as
well as the JNI glue C++ code that lets the Java implementation reuse the C++
implementation of the same API.

To build the Java API and related tests, include
libjingle_java=1 build_with_libjingle=1 build_with_chromium=0
in $GYP_DEFINES.

To use the Java API, start by looking at the public interface of
org.webrtc.PeerConnection{,Factory} and the org.webrtc.PeerConnectionTest.

To understand the implementation of the API, see the native code in jni/.

An example command-line to build & run the unittest:
export R=path/to/trunk
cd $R
GYP_GENERATORS=ninja GYP_DEFINES="libjingle_java=1 build_with_libjingle=1 build_with_chromium=0" gclient runhooks
ninja -C out/Debug libjingle_peerconnection_test_jar
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$R/out/Debug java -classpath ${R}/third_party/junit/junit-4.11.jar:${R}/out/Debug/libjingle_peerconnection_test.jar:${R}/out/Debug/libjingle_peerconnection.jar junit.textui.TestRunner org.webrtc.PeerConnectionTest

During development it can be helpful to run the JVM with the -Xcheck:jni flag.
