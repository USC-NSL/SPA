Description:
The Hyper-Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is perhaps the most significant
protocol used on the Internet today. Web services, network-enabled appliances
and the growth of network computing continue to expand the role of the HTTP
protocol beyond user-driven web browsers, while increasing the number of
applications that require HTTP support.

Although the java.net package provides basic functionality for accessing
resources via HTTP, it doesn't provide the full flexibility or functionality
needed by many applications. HttpClient seeks to fill this void by providing
an efficient, up-to-date, and feature-rich package implementing the client side
of the most recent HTTP standards and recommendations.

Designed for extension while providing robust support for the base HTTP
protocol, HttpClient may be of interest to anyone building HTTP-aware client
applications such as web browsers, web service clients, or systems that leverage
or extend the HTTP protocol for distributed communication.

None.

Update instructions:
1. Find the new version you want on the project website.  Use as $VERSION below:
   $ VERSION={version from website}
2. Download the binary distribution tarball.
3. Verify MD5 sum of package with online version:
   $ md5sum httpcomponents-client-$VERSION-bin.tar.gz
4. Remove the binary-distribution subdirectory:
   $ rm -rf binary-distribution/
5. Extract the contents of the tarball into binary-distribution subdirectory:
   $ tar xvfz httpcomponents-client-$VERSION-bin.tar.gz
   $ mv httpcomponents-client-$VERSION binary-distribution
6. Update httpcomponents-client.gyp:httpcomponents_client_javalib with path to
   new Java jar, eg:
   'input_jar_file': 'binary-distribution/lib/httpclient-$VERSION.jar',
7. Update httpcomponents-client.gyp:httpcomponents_mime_javalib with path to
   new Java jar, eg:
   'input_jar_file': 'binary-distribution/lib/httpmime-$VERSION.jar',
