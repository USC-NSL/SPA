Description: ActivePython for Windows.

Local Modifications:
* Installed ActivePython. Did not install the Documentation feature nor
  register it as the default python.
* Moved the following files from \windows\system32 to the
  python folder:
    * python26.dll
    * pythoncom26.dll
    * pywintypes26.dll
  This is the only way to get these DLLs earlier in the search order than those
  from a local install of PyWin32.  See:
  http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms682586(VS.85).aspx
* Made a copy of pywintypes26.dll in Lib\site-packages\win32.  This is
  necessary for the .pyd files in this directory to load it in preference to a
  local copy in \windows\system32.
* Added setup_env.bat
* Added google.pth link to tools/google
* Installed py2exe from www.py2exe.org, and copied the whole py2exe folder
  as well as _memimporter.pyd, py2exe-0.6.9-py2.6.egg-info and zipextimporter.py
  under Lib\site-packages.
* Deleted *.pyc *.pyo files from the tree.
* Set svn:executable recursively on *.dll *.exe *.py *.pyd *.pyw.  Set
  svn:eol-style to LF recursively on *.py *.pyw.

On Windows, Python is most useful with the PyWin32 extensions installed.  These
extensions provide process control and filesystem APIs (linking, etc.) which
are available in posix versions of Python, but not built into the Windows
version.  Several other third-party packages such as SCons require PyWin32.

RULES FOR WHERE PYTHON ADDONS SHOULD BE CHECKED IN:

Most other client-side addons for Python should be checked into
.../third_party/py, rather than being directly installed in
the same directory as Python.

Follow this decision tree to determine where your addon should live:

  1. Does the add-on supply a .dll file?
        NO -  Stop, we're safe.  The add-on can live in its own subdirectory in
              third_party/py.
        YES - Continue to step 2.

  2. Does the add-on install its .dll underneath the Windows directory?
        NO -  Stop, we're safe.  The add-on can live in its own subdirectory in
              third_party/py.  Your setup_env.bat file must PREPEND the
              directory containing the .dll to the path, so that it will be
              found before a locally-installed copy of the package.
        YES - Continue to step 3.

  3. Does the add-on supply a .pyd file?
        NO -  Continue to step 4.
        YES - Check if the .pyd file depends directly on the DLL.  If it does,
              the DLL must be copied to the same directory as the .pyd.
              Continue to step 4 to determine if the DLL must also be copied to
              the same directory as python.exe.

  4. Does the add-on call LoadLibrary(), either in its own .pyd file, or via
     pywin32?
        NO -  Stop, we're safe.  The add-on can live in its own subdirectory in
              third_party/py.
        YES - Stop, the DLL must be placed in the same directory as python.exe,
              so the add-on must be installed in third_party/python_24.

Unfortunately, PyWin32 falls into the least-hermetic category.  It installs
.dll files into \windows\system32, which are referenced both directly by its
.pyd files and indirectly via LoadLibrary() calls.
