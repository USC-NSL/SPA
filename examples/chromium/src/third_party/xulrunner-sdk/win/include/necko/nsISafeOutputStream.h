/**
 * This interface provides a mechanism to control an output stream
 * that takes care not to overwrite an existing target until it is known
 * that all writes to the destination succeeded.
 * 
 * An object that supports this interface is intended to also support
 * nsIOutputStream.
 *
 * For example, a file output stream that supports this interface writes to
 * a temporary file, and moves it over the original file when |finish| is
 * called only if the stream can be successfully closed and all writes
 * succeeded.  If |finish| is called but something went wrong during
 * writing, it will delete the temporary file and not touch the original.
 * If the stream is closed by calling |close| directly, or the stream
 * goes away, the original file will not be overwritten, and the temporary
 * file will be deleted.
 *
 * Currently, this interface is implemented only for file output streams.
