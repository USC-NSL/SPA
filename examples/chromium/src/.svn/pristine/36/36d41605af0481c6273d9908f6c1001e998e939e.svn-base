<h1>Publish</h1>
<!--  -->

<p>
Packaged apps are still evolving.
We're giving you an early look at how to build them,
but it's a developer preview;
they aren't ready yet for building production applications.
</p>

<p>This means that you can't just yet publish your packaged apps
in the Chrome Web Store &mdash; but you will be able to do so very soon.</p>

<p>What you can do (as described throughout this guide),
is load your unpackaged app to the apps and extensions management page
and try out your app from a new tab in the Chrome browser.</p>

<p>In case you haven't tried it yet,
here's how to load your app:</p>

<ol>
	<li style="margin-top:0" />
      Bring up the apps and extensions management page
      by clicking the Chrome menu icon
      <img src="{{static}}/images/hotdogmenu.png" width="29" height="29" alt=""
        style="margin-top:0" />
      and choosing <b>Tools > Extensions</b>.
    </li>
    <li>
      Make sure the <b>Developer mode</b>
      checkbox has been selected.
    </li>
    <li>
      Click the <b>Load unpacked extension</b> button.
      A file dialog appears.
    </li>
    <li>
      In the file dialog,
      navigate to your app's folder
      and click <b>OK</b>.
    </li>
</ol>
