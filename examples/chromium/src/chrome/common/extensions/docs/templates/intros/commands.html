<h2 id="manifest">Manifest</h2>
<p>
You must set manifest_version to (at least) 2 to use this API.
</p>

<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>
<p>The commands API allows you to define specific commands, and bind them to a
default key combination. Each command your extension accepts must be listed in
the manifest as an attribute of the 'commands' manifest key. Note: Combinations
that involve Ctrl+Alt are not permitted in order to avoid conflicts with the
AltGr key. Also note that on Mac 'Ctrl' is automatically converted to 'Command'.
If you want 'Ctrl' instead, please specify 'MacCtrl'.</p>

<p>An extension can have many commands but only 4 suggested keys can be
specified. The user can manually add more shortcuts from the chrome://extensions
page.</p>

<pre>{
  "name": "My extension",
  ...
<b>  "commands": {
    "toggle-feature-foo": {
      "suggested_key": {
        "default": "Ctrl+Shift+Y",
        "mac": "Command+Shift+Y"
      },
      "description": "Toggle feature foo"
    },
    "_execute_browser_action": {
      "suggested_key": {
        "windows": "Ctrl+Shift+Y",
        "mac": "Command+Shift+Y",
        "chromeos": "Ctrl+Shift+U",
        "linux": "Ctrl+Shift+J"
      }
    },
    "_execute_page_action": {
      "suggested_key": {
        "default": "Ctrl+E"
        "windows": "Alt+P",
        "mac": "Option+P",
      }
    }
  }</b>,
  ...
}</pre>

<p>In your background page, you can bind a handler to each of the commands
defined in the manifest (except for '_execute_browser_action' and
'_execute_page_action') via onCommand.addListener. For example:</p>

<pre>
chrome.commands.onCommand.addListener(function(command) {
  console.log('Command:', command);
});
</pre>

<p>The '_execute_browser_action' and '_execute_page_action' commands are
reserved for the action of opening your extension's popups. They won't normally
generate events that you can handle. If you need to take action based on your
popup opening, consider listening for an 'onDomReady' event inside your popup's
code.
</p>
