// ParallelAuthenticator and then call Resolve().  Resolve() will attempt to
// determine which AuthState we're in, based on the info at hand.
// It then triggers further action based on the calculated AuthState; this
// further action might include calling back the passed-in LoginStatusConsumer
// to signal that login succeeded or failed, waiting for more outstanding
// operations to complete, or triggering some more Cryptohome method calls.
