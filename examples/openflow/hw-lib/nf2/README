NetFPGA Hardware Table
  Date - 03/09/10
----------------------------------------

This library creates and maintains a single software table that contains all
the flows that are currently held in the NetFPGA card. The card itself splits
exact match flows into SRAM and wildcard match flows into TCAMs. Currently
there are 24 usable wildcard flow entries and 32,768 available exact match
entries. The exact match table is hashed so actual available entries will be
varied.

Installation
----------------------------------------

First build OpenFlow ensuring you include the directive to build the
openflow_netfpga hardware table in your configure statement:

	% ./configure --enable-hw-lib=nf2

For further help regarding building OpenFlow please see the INSTALL file in
the OpenFlow root directory.

Platform support
----------------

OpenFlow v1.0 with NetFPGA hardware table has been tested on CentOS5.4
(Linux 2.6.18), which is the officially supported platform of NetFPGA.

Running
----------------------------------------

Use nf2_download to download the openflow_switch.bit file that is located in
the <openflow>/datapath/hwtable_nf2 folder:

	% nf2_download -r <openflow>/hw-lib/nf2/openflow_switch.bit

'-r' option enables PHY interrupt for its link status changing, and OpenFlow
switch can detect it.

Run ofdatapth with indicating *all* the NetFPGA interfaces:

	% <openflow>/udatapath/ofdatapath punix:/var/run/test \
	   -i nf2c0,nf2c1,nf2c2,nf2c3

At this point your OpenFlow switch should be ready to go.
The way you start up ofprotocol is as same as you do for software reference
switch.

Known Issues
----------------------------------------
* There is currently no support for priority amongst wildcard-match entries.
