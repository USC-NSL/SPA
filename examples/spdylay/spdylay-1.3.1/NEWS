spdylay 1.3.1
=============

Release Note
------------

This release fix the bug in spdylay_session_consume function.

Changes
-------

* Fix bug that connection window is consumed excessively

  Previously we consider bytes as consumed in
  spdylay_session_mem_recv() even if it is not ignored and is passing
  to application.  As a result, excessive number of bytes are
  considered as consumed and library sends excessive amount of
  WINDOW_UPDATE to peer.  This commit fixes this bug.



spdylay 1.3.0
=============

Release Note
------------

This release adds new API function spdylay_session_consume() and the
new option SPDYLAY_OPT_NO_AUTO_WINDOW_UPDATE2 to enable that
functionality.  This is a preferred way to manually control local flow
window.  This effectively deprecates SPDYLAY_OPT_NO_AUTO_WINDOW_UPDATE
option.

Changes
-------

* Add spdylay_session_consume() API

  This function is back ported from nghttp2 project.  This is a
  preferred way to manually control flow window.
  SPDYLAY_OPT_NO_AUTO_WINDOW_UPDATE is not deprecated.  New
  application should use SPDYLAY_OPT_NO_AUTO_WINDOW_UPDATE2 and use
  spdylay_session_consume() to tell the library how many bytes
  application consumed.
