    Fix bug that connection window is consumed excessively
    
    Previously we consider bytes as consumed in spdylay_session_mem_recv()
    even if it is not ignored and is passing to application.  As a result,
    excessive number of bytes are considered as consumed and library sends
    excessive amount of WINDOW_UPDATE to peer.  This commit fixes this
    bug.
