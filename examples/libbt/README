LibBT 1.06-pre1

Description:

LibBT is a C reimplementation of the BitTorrent core protocols.  Our
goal for the project is to develop a low overhead library version of 
the protocols so that BitTorrent transfers can easily be built in to 
any existing application.

The sample applications included with LibBT currently run in between 
2Mb and 3.5Mb of memory (RSS), depending on the number of peers that 
are attached.

LibBT is currently targeted at the Linux Operating System.

Prerequisites:

The following libraries should already be installed on your
system:

* OpenSSL (http://www.openssl.org/)
* LibCURL (http://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/)
* libuuid-dev (or e2fsprogs-devel in some distributions)

If you are building prerequisite libraries from source then don't forget 
to add the library install directory to /etc/ld.so.conf, and run ldconfig, 
or add the library directory to your LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable.

Build instructions:

After unpacking the source tree you will find that the project has been
set up to build with autoconf.  The sources have only been tested on 
various Redhat distributions of Linux.  Please let me know if you complete
a port to another distribution or operating system.

To build the sources you must first run configure, and then make as shown
in the example below.  


    $ ./configure
    $ make


In this early release there is only a static library available, together
with three sample applications; btlist, btget, and btcheck.  There is 
currently no 'make install' target, but the sample applications can be
copied anywhere that you find convenient, and should still run.

If changing the autoconf scripts then the following commands will rebuild
the configure and config.h.in files:

    $ autoconf
    $ configure
    $ autoheader
    $ configure
