Purpose:

  Create a portable C library for SPDY that lets applications easily do
  many streams over a single connection without having to know much protocol
  details.

Origin:

  We started by importing the libspdy git repository. We have since then
  modified and extended it beyond what was originally the plan and we can most
  likely never merge with the original project again - should they emerge
  again from their deep sleep.

Contribute:

  Please do! See doc/HACKING for how!
