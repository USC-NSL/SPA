.SH NAME
fmt_utf8 \- encode 31-bit unsigned integer using UTF-8 rules
.SH SYNTAX
.B #include <fmt.h>

size_t \fBfmt_utf8\fP(char *\fIdest\fR,uint32_t \fIsource\fR);
.SH DESCRIPTION
fmt_utf8 encodes a 31-bit unsigned integer using the UTF-8 rules.  This
can take from 1 byte (0-0x7f) up to 5 bytes (0x4000000-0x7fffffff).
Values larger than 0x7fffffff cannot be represented in this encoding.

If \fIdest\fR equals FMT_LEN (i.e. is NULL), fmt_utf8 returns the
number of bytes it would have written.

For convenience, fmt.h defines the integer FMT_UTF8 to be big enough to
contain every possible fmt_utf8 output.
