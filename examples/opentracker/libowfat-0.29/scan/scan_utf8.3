.SH NAME
scan_utf8 \- decode an unsigned integer from UTF-8 encoding
.SH SYNTAX
.B #include <scan.h>

size_t \fBscan_utf8\fP(const char *\fIsrc\fR,size_t \fIlen\fR,uint32_t *\fIdest\fR);
.SH DESCRIPTION
scan_utf8 decodes an unsigned integer in UTF-8 encoding from a memory
area holding binary data.  It writes the decode value in \fIdest\fR and
returns the number of bytes it read from \fIsrc\fR.

scan_utf8 never reads more than \fIlen\fR bytes from \fIsrc\fR.  If the
sequence is longer than that, or the memory area contains an invalid
sequence, scan_utf8 returns 0 and does not touch \fIdest\fR.

The length of the longest UTF-8 sequence is 5.  If the buffer is longer
than that, and scan_utf8 fails, then the data was not a valid UTF-8
encoded sequence.
