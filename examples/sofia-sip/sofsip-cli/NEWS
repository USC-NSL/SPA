NEWS for sofsip-cli
===================

List of changes in each public release of sofsip-cli (most 
recent at the top).

Changes in release: 0.16 (2009-03-02)
-------------------------------------

- Various compile problems related to the removed "fsgst"
  media backend. So continuing the theme from 0.15, this 
  is now a release that also compiles. ;)

Changes in release: 0.15 (2009-01-26)
-------------------------------------

- A release tarball that actually works -- a big improvement 
  since the v0.14 release. ;)
- Fixed building without libnice (error when linking nice_tester).
  Thanks to Stefano Sabatini for the bug report.
- Updated to support libnice 0.0.4 (older versions are no longer
  supported). See http://nice.freedesktop.org/wiki to
  download the latest release.
- Cross-compiling was not working due to invalid include 
  directory list. Patch from Keith Mok.
- Removed "farsight" and "fsgst" media backend implementations from 
  the source tree. "farsight" was never fully operational, while 
  "fsgst" no longer works with the most recent versions of Gstreamer. 
  Fortunately there are now projects like telepathy-sofiasip (see 
  <https://sourceforge.net/projects/tp-sofiasip>)  and 
  telapathy-stream-engine (see 
  <http://telepathy.freedesktop.org/releases/stream-engine/>) that
  serve as much better, and especially more up-to-date, examples of
  how to integrate Sofia-SIP signaling to media path setup, and how to 
  implement  the media path with Gstreamer.

Changes in release: 0.14 (2008-03-11)
-------------------------------------

- Now requires Sofia-SIP 1.12.3 or newer.
- Use of STUN for SIP signalling (NAT/FW traversal) is now disabled 
  by default.
- Added a new media implementation "nice" that serves as 
  a testing tool for the NICE library (IETF-ICE implementation).
  Added "nice_tester" utility to the distribution. See README for 
  more details.
- Fixed bug in auto-answer (--autoanswer) feature. The media
  session was not correctly setup when auto-answering.
- Fixed various minor bugs in the codebase.

Changes in release: 0.13 (2007-05-31)
-------------------------------------

- Use a random local UDP port for SIP by default (can be overridden 
  with the "--contact" command-line option.
- Fixed bugs in initiating multiple media sessions with "gstreamer" 
  backend.
- Fixed bug in responding to an 401/407 authentication challenge with
  no realm.
- Request for a lower, 180sec, registration refresh interval from 
  the registrar by default.

Changes in release: 0.12 (2006-10-20)
-------------------------------------

- Added a build time options (see SOFSIP_USE_GLIB_EVENT_LOOP
  in src/sofsip_cli.c) to disable use of the glib eventloop,
  and use of sofia-sip's own event loop instead. Glib/object
  are still mandatory libraries, but this allows to better
  understand which code is dependent on glib/object.
- Moved streamer specific utilities from gsdp_utils.h to
  ssc_media_gst_utils.h, renamed gsdp_utils.h to sdp_utils.h
- Added summary output to the end of "./configure" runs.
- Added a welcome to interactive mode banner.
- Added 'set' (for settings) command to interactive mode.
- Fixed a bug which caused a segfault when CTRL-D (like with
  "echo h |./sofsip_cli") was received.
- Fixed a bug in rejecting an incoming call.
- Farsight is now disabled by default to avoid compilation
  problems with different Farsight versions. You can reenable
  it with "--with-farsight" configure option. This change 
  does not affect the "fsgst" media implementation. See README
  for more details about the different implementations.

Changes in release: 0.11 (2006-08-07)
------------------------------------

- Fixed a dumb bug in input parsing: a command starting
  with white-space (like ' m sip:foobar@somedomain.org' would
  cause a segfault). Problem reported by Johannes Eickhold.
- Added '--with-default-audio=FOO' configure switch. Allows
  to select the default audio subsystem (see sofsip_cli(1)
  man page and documentation for the SOFSIP_AUDIO environment 
  variable).
- Added a workaround for changed audio sink behaviour in
  gstreamer-0.10.9. See #348677 at http://bugzilla.gnome.org.
  Also #348675 affects sofsip-cli users.
- Added some special case code for N770 gstreamer pipeline 
  setup. Enable by compiling with '--with-default-audio=N770'
  or by setting the 'SOFSIP_AUDIO=N770' enviroment variable
  on runtime. Code contributed by Johannes Eickhold.

Changes in release: 0.10 (2006-05-31)
------------------------------------

- More fixes to media setup problems when STUN is not 
  used (as reported by H.L.).

Changes in release: 0.9 (2006-05-30)
------------------------------------

- Renamed 'gstreamer' media implementation to 'fsgst', and
  added a new 'gstreamer' implementation that relies only
  on basic GStreamer elements (gstreamer, gst-plugins-base and
  gst-plugins-good). The 'fsgst' uses GStreamer plus additional
  plugins provided by the gst-plugins-farsight package (for RTP 
  jitter buffering and RTCP support). See the updated README file 
  for more information.
- Fixed a bug that caused segfaults if communication failed
  with the STUN server (reported by H.L.).
- Added 'SOFSIP_AUDIO' environment variable. See sofsip_cli(1)
  for some documentation.

Changes in release: 0.8 (2006-05-23)
------------------------------------

- Now requires sofia-sip-1.11.8 or newer.
- Extended the 'k' command syntax. It is now sufficient to just
  give the password as a parameter (e.g. "k mysecret"). The 'scheme/method' 
  and 'realm' fields are taken from the challenge sent by server (from 
  the 'WWW-Authenticate' and 'Proxy-Authenticate' SIP headers), and
  'username' from SIP 'From' header. It is still possible to specify
  all authentication information explicitly using the old 
  colon-separated-fields syntax. 
- Added initial support for Farsight as a media subsystem (enable
  with '--media-impl=farsight'. Is not fully working yet. 
- To use the gstreamer media implementation, this release requires 
  gst-plugins-farsight 2005-05-13 snapshot or newer.
- If Farsight or Gstreamer libraries are not found at build time,
  support for them is automatically disabled.

Changes in release: 0.7 (2006-02-16)
------------------------------------

- Renamed "--media" to "--media-addr".
- Added "--media-impl={dummy,gstreamer,farsight}" for 
  selecting which media implementation to use.
- Added "--autoanswer={yes,no} for controlling auto-answer
  feature.
- Updated to work with the new sofia-sip header namespace. Now requires
  sofia-sip-1.11.6 to build.
Ã-Added "addr <sip-uri>" command for changing the public
  address (AoR) after startup.

Changes in release: 0.6 (2006-02-15)
------------------------------------

- The gstreamer-rtp media subsystem is now only selected if
  correct versions of all required gstreamer plugins are
  available at runtime.
- Improved the user-inteface for authentication handling,
  so that users don't need to provide the challenge realm and 
  scheme anymore, just the username and password.

Changes in release: 0.5 (2006-02-10)
------------------------------------

- First release of the modified sofia-sip/utils/nua_cli.c 
  program that was part of 1.11.0-1.11.5 Sofia-SIP releases.
- Modified to use new libraries: GNU readline, glib (GOption, 
  various others), gstreamer (media subsystem).
- Added documentation: README, sofsip_cli(1) man page.
- Updated the set of command-line and environment variables
  for configuring sofsip-cli.
